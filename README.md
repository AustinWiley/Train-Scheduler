# Train-scheduler

## About the App

* This is a simple app which allows you to create a train schedule.
* I use firebase to store the train schedule data.
* I have some form validition so that if you do not complete all fields a modal will pop up and request for you to complete the form.  
* I have also created form validation that requires you to enter the correct data type.


## Other features I could add but havn't yet

* I could make it so you have to log in to use the app.
* I could also have the times update every minute.

**Notes** I used mostly `<div>` elements in the html of this project.  I also used bootstrap.
